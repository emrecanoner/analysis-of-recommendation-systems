Abstract—In our work, we have presented two widely used
recommendation systems. We have presented a context-aware recommender
system to filter the items associated with user’s interests coupled with a contextbased recommender system to prescribe those items. In this study, contextaware recommender systems perceive the user’s location, time, and company.
The context-based recommender system retrieves patterns from World Wide
Web-based on the user’s past interactions and provides future news
recommendations. We have presented different techniques to support media
recommendations for smartphones, to create a framework for context-aware, to
filter E-learning content, and to deliver convenient news to the user. To achieve
this goal, we have used content-based, collaborative filtering, a hybrid
recommender system, and implemented a Web ontology language (OWL). We
have also used the Resource Description Framework (RDF), JAVA, machine
learning, semantic mapping rules, and natural ontology languages that suggest
user items related to the search. In our work, we have used E-paper to provide
users with the required news. After applying the semantic reasoning approach,
we have concluded that by some means, this approach works similarly as a
content-based recommender system since by taking the gain of a semantic
approach, we can also recommend items according to the user’s interests. In a
content-based recommender system, the system provides additional options or
results that rely on the user’s ratings, appraisals, and interests.

Introduction

Recommender systems are software gears and techniques which offer
recommendations for users. Recommendations can be of various kinds such as music
tracks, news, and movie recommendations. The recommendation system provides
recommendations by keeping user interest and using contextual information into
account. The abundance of available information indicates the extreme need to
overcome irrelevant information [1]. The recommender system is the building block
of data filtering [2]. The aim of building a recommender system is to provide
maximum information required for personalized learning and interests depending on
the interactive patterns of the clients [3, 4]. Contextual information is effectively used
to make significant recommendations in various fields. However, still, there is a great
need to resolve issues like abundant information, data redundancy, and context
redundancy to generate more effective recommendations [5]. The previously proposed
existing approaches do not provide a thorough solution to these problems. To address
the challenges of more effective recommendations generation, we have proposed a
content-based recommender system and context-aware recommender system.
Context-Aware Recommender Systems (CARS) is a specific category of
recommender systems that takes contextual information as an input and provides
additional useful suggestions. Simultaneously, the content-based framework shows a
chart of the field of recommender systems and depicts the present period of
recommendation strategies that are regularly described with three essential
arrangements: content-based, collective, and hybrid proposition approaches, i.e.,
hybrid.
Context is a versatile idea studied across distinct analysis disciplines and
computing, science, linguistics, philosophy, psychology, and structure sciences. The
change over the conventional data recovery approaches originates from customer
profiles that possess knowledge about customers' tastes, slants, and pre-requisites. The
content recovery group has contributed a few methods that are being utilized as a part
of content-based recommender frameworks. Content-based strategies are constrained
by the components that are explicitly connected with the items prescribed by these
items. In this way, to have an adequate arrangement of elements, the content should
either be in a shape that can be parsed naturally by a PC or the components should be
substantially allocated. Since content-based archives are generally addressed by their
most vital and essential content/phrases, content-based frameworks cannot recognize
an elegantly composed article. They must be kept in touch with one, on the off chance
that they happen to utilize similar terms.
The primary purpose of a recommender system is to provide users with
recommendations. Other than providing significant recommendations, the
recommender systems also successfully address the information overload dilemma.
Most of the already existing recommender systems only target recommending the
most relevant information related to the user’s search and contextual data. For
example, time and place are not included in those systems. However, the currently
used modern recommendation systems also include contextual information and
personalization aspects into research [6].

Moreover, in various applications such as the holiday recommendation system,
movie recommendation system, only users and items information is insufficient and
contextual information is highly needed. For example, a travel recommender system
provides suggestions for various suitable vocation packages according to different
weathers.
Recommender frameworks provide customized counsel to clients about things they
may be keen on. These apparatuses help individuals proficiently oversee content overburden and lessen multifaceted nature while hunting down essential data. There are
three fundamental components required to achieve personalization.
• Database to store portrayals of the accessible things,
• Profiles to model clients' inclinations and
• Proposal procedures to generate customized proposals for every person.
We have also discussed context-aware recommender systems that will provide us
with the idea that contextual information can provide better recommendations. The
main contributions of our work on context-aware recommender systems are:
1. We have illustrated distributions of journal paper publications per year for
ontology-based recommendations from 2003-2014
2. We have investigated various information and recommendation representation
techniques. We have also examined various types of context-aware learning
resources. We have taken knowledge-based resources into consideration which are
generated by ontology-based recommenders
3. We have also reviewed future research ideas for recommender systems

Recommendation Techniques / Methods

The semantic-based approach is ceaselessly being used in recommendation
systems, and it has been proved as a better system for item recommendations. The
currently widely used techniques are content-based, collaborative filtering, and hybrid
techniques. By using any of these recommendation techniques and user preferences
and appraisals, feasible information retrieval is possible. We have also used semanticbased recommendation systems. The most significant stride in the recommendation
system is the extraction step. It brings about building up an archive subject guide by
executing a web 2.0 administration to remove report elements. Recommendation
arrangement of the examples enables educators to utilize straightforwardly the
examples that offer answers for a specific issue that they face and enhances the
powers. It likewise advances the input that is given by educators. It generates
acceptable outcomes, enhances learning aptitudes, and opens the entryway to
stimulate advancement and recommendation frameworks. In our assessment for the
factual examination, we have considered factors, for instance, assorted qualities of the
proposals, evaluations in types identified with the recommended programs, seeing
propensities, and so on. All these factors together contribute to generating
recommendations according to the client requirement. To generate efficiently related

276

and accurate recommendations, it is highly needed to increase information access and
personalization. Figure 1 indicates the number of papers and their year of publication,
which we have considered in our work.

2.1

Semantic reasoning/semantic-based approach

The semantic-based approach is another data retrieval approach, along with content
and collaborative approaches. The semantic standards are utilized to expand the
concentrated learning way to recognize semantic connections among people. In
particular, we have suggested a semantic model for every client who provides data
about
i.

iii.

Interesting and boring TV shows for the client (called: positive and negative
inclinations)
The primary characteristics
Class of these projects in which they are characterized in the TV ontology

In past work, we researched a semantics-based way to deal with news proposals
using equivalent word sets (synsets) from Word-Net [7]. The utilization of semantic
Web advances to formally speak to information can give a few points of interest
regarding customized suggestion frameworks: the dynamic contextualization of
clients' interests in particular spaces, the assurance of between operability of
framework assets, and the derivation of fragmented data about client's interests. We
believe that the up-and-coming era of recommenders should concentrate on how their
personalization procedures can exploit semantics and social information to enhance
their proposals. Semantic suggestion frameworks are described by the joining of
semantic information in their procedures with a specific end goal to enhance the
proposal's quality. A conceivable approach to conquer issues of vagueness may be
using an ontology, i.e., a controlled vocabulary of terms or ideas, and their semantic
connections. We sometimes misuse suchlike semantic foundation information keeping

277

Paper—A Review of Content-Based and Context-Based Recommendation Systems

in mind the end goal to use effective surmising open doors for making client profiles
because of the items these last clients obtained, more significant.
The ontological domain takes the state of the semantic system that utilized ideas of
client profile interests. Adjustment of Semantic by User Preferences is the most
straightforward approach. The weights would be able to set by the client. In any case,
it likewise has a few downsides since client inclinations are regularly to stay
unaltered. Therefore, changes take time. Semantic Web structure is utilized for
building the customized news administrations. It utilized Ontology for investigation
of content, for the introduction of information, for semantic inquiries.
Ontologies have turned into the foundation of the Semantic Web because of two
reasons. From one viewpoint, formal conceptualizations empower deduction
procedures to find new learning from the spoke to data. On alternate, ontologies
encourage computerized learning sharing by permitting simple reuse amongst clients
and programming specialists. Records disregarded are prepared, and critical faculties
(disambiguated over Word-Net) are extricated and afterward joined to frame a
semantic system. The modifying method powerfully predicts new reports on the
premise of the semantic system. As the client peruses the reports, the framework
fabricates the client show as a semantic system whose hubs speak to detects (not
merely words) of the records asked for by the client. Semantic web innovation is that
as it may, too dependent on how much creators comment on their site pages, and
programmed page explanation is still in its earliest stages.
2.2

Ontology representation language

The languages used in content-based recommender systems are OWL, SWRL,
RDF, and semantic mapping rules, etc. Semantic Web analysts resort to ontologies,
which speak to the learning about every framework (by utilizing classes, properties,
and particular examples) and by various standardized arrangements (for example,
RDF, RDFS, and OWL). Semantic Web scientists fall back on ontologies, which
speak to the learning about the domain of every framework (by utilizing classes,
particular occurrences, and properties) by various standardized configurations (for
example, RDF, RDFS, and OWL). E-learning proposal in this structure depends on
SWRL, OWL, and lead-based suggestion system [8]. The word Web of Data mostly
used as Semantic Web, Web 3.0, or combined Data, shows another era of
advancements in charge of developing today’s Web: A Web of connected data. The
objective is to find new information from information utilizing standards (primarily
RDF). We have proposed how Semantic Web headways and particularly ontologies
can be used for upgrading functionalities of a present Java training system [9]. The
outline for such an adaptable and customized mentoring framework that depends on
Semantic Web instructions and developments has been displayed. The sort of a couple
of ontologies has been proposed which identity with the parts of a coaching
framework.
Comprehensively, our substance-based technique chooses from the OWL
philosophy examples of parts and properties suitable for the customer, by considering
his/her inclinations. The data has extreme constraints demonstrated in HTML, which

278

http://www.i-jet.org

Paper—A Review of Content-Based and Context-Based Recommendation Systems

is intended for people to read instead of machines to translate and natural processes.
We have partitioned the ontology into 2 sections for proficient store and questioning
of OWL information. In this way, various levelled data of class and property is put
away utilizing OWL, and occurrence data is utilized in a social database. Through
them, we can obtain more efficiency. To build the ontology, we have made the facility
domain and activity domain. Every domain comprises of subordinate ideas, occasions,
and properties. The ontology recovery framework comprises of the crawler, the
arranging module, the positioning module, and the recovery module. A crawler is
used to parse the Web HTML records. The arranging module performs a
characterization of parsed OWL/RDF. The positioning module selects the request
made by space ontologies. Finally, the recovery module provides a client interface for
recovered ontologies. For our framework, we make the ontology perception
instrument and course suggestion framework utilizing Java. Specific domains can be
achieved by using different ontologies languages. OWL and RDF are the most
sequentially used languages that are used to build ontologies. Semantic rules are
specifically designed to introduce inference rules. The ontology languages sometimes
include reasoning and semantic rules that support content-based recommender
systems. Also, these languages facilitate content-based systems to recommend
different things to users according to their interests and profiles or rating.
The semantic standards are utilized to expand the concentrated learning way to
recognize semantic connections among people. SWRL is a rising XML-based
structure for building administers over OWL ontology. Amid the run building stage,
clients can compose rules utilizing a Horn-like language structure, and after
translating into the SWRL arrange. The SWRL standards can be altered on the
Protégé OWL stage by choosing the ''SWRL Tab". The inner database of our ontology
is an OWL domain ontology developed by domain specialists and is questioned
utilizing expanded SPARQL inquiries. Most of the semantic reasoning approach
utilizes an idea-based way to enhance the client profile portrayal (client demonstrating
stage) and utilize standard vocabularies and ontology language like OWL. By and
large, utilizing things as labels (rather than marks) involves some fundamental
favourable circumstances. Things are recognized by URIs and marked by RDFs: label
or elective names: alt Label. This plan defeats existing semantic issues, for example,
equivalent words, homonyms, acronyms, and diverse spelling, which current labelling
frameworks endure, and by isolating the label's name from its recognizable proof.
Furthermore, things may have an arrangement of further depicting RDF properties to
recover similarities better.
The cross-dialect client profile is performed by the Profile Learner, which gathers
the profile as a double content classifier. The latest ways to deal with Cross-Language
Retrieval essentially depend on the utilization of vast corpora like Wikipedia. The
approach depends on Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA), stretching out the first model
to cross-lingual recovery settings [10]. Implementation of e-paper depends on the
standard OWL dialect. We manufacture charts, not a tree, and even more
straightforward—second strategy: Sem-News, which gives the casing work to
comprehend the news. The utilization of faculties instead of words infers that the
subsequent client demonstrates more precise and autonomous from the language of

iJET ‒ Vol. 16, No. 03, 2021

279

Paper—A Review of Content-Based and Context-Based Recommendation Systems

the documents perused. This is especially critical for multi-language sites ending up
exceptionally regular, particularly in news locales or the electronic business domain.
The preferred primary standpoint in utilizing Word-Net is that types of languages
other than English are presently accessible. The fundamental focal points of interest
of the semantic approach are that semantic exactness increments and that the model is
free from the dialect of the news. The inquiry terms are chosen for Web look by
adjusting synopsis and natural language handling methods to remove catchphrases
from privately put away desktop records. There exist a few standard execution
dialects for ontology advancement.
The primary propositions were RDF and RDFS, which added a formal semantic to
the syntactic particulars in XML. Next, DAML and OIL emerged, which have been at
long last combined and institutionalized by W3C as OWL, the most expressive
language these days counting three sub-levels (Lite, DL, and Full). The language to
use in the utilization of our thinking driven approach depends on the information and
expressiveness necessities of the recommender framework.
2.3

Role of classification and categorization of previous researches

The main objective of classifying and categorizing previously done work is to
achieve an easy clear understanding of the implementation of the content-based
recommender system in various fields. The goal is to elaborate on how the contentbased recommender systems have achieved better performance in the modern era. All
the publications are based on content-based recommender systems. For example, the
papers belong to the recommendation of news according to the user’s interests,
content-based recommender system in e-learning, and recommend users traveling
places [11].

Context-Aware Recommender Systems

Context-aware recommender systems have been swiftly blooming as an effective
way for relevant and useful learning retrieval according to contextual information.
Recommendation techniques are classified into four different classes which include:
Utility-based recommendation techniques, collaborative filtering, content-based
recommendation techniques, and hybrid recommendation techniques. Each approach
has its gains and losses. In our work, we have used collaborative filtering, contentbased, knowledge-based, ontology-based techniques, and hybrid recommendations.
3.1

Collaborative based filtering

Collaborative filtering methods are based totally on gathering and analysing a large
amount of data on user's behaviours, activities, or preferences and predicting what
users will like based totally on their similarity. Some well-known e-commerce web
sites propose such recommendations with success factors, based on a record of user

280

http://www.i-jet.org

Paper—A Review of Content-Based and Context-Based Recommendation Systems

actions, user ratings, or correlations between different users (collaborative filtering
principles) [12].
Some recommender frameworks, for example, Movielens [13], depend on
collaborative filtering to customize the proposal of things. The PPG depends on a
multi-operator design that encourages the mix of various client displaying methods to
acknowledge the TV watcher's inclinations and the proposal of the projects to watch
[14]. Since another thing has no perusing history, the separating and-personalization
cannot depend on collaborative filtering (instead of different domains, for example,
the proposal of books, films, and so on.), yet instead need to depend on content-based
sifting, so once another thing lands to the News archive, the content-based sifting
calculation can play out the essential coordinating with the clients' profiles and decide
the level of importance of everything to the potential clients. Collaborative filtering
recommender frameworks do this by requesting that individual’s rate expressly pages
and after that prescribe new pages that comparative clients have appraised very—
collaborative filtering strategy matched individuals with comparable inclinations to
make proposals. The favourable principle position of CF finished content is called
fresh. Another method joins Content Characteristics with a Collaborative Approach. It
utilizes a forecast plot like the standard collective filtering called cooperation
employing content. It does not figure out the ratings that give by the clients yet
considering the content profiles of every client. The fundamental fault of this
approach is that the closeness of clients depends on people's relationships between
content weight vectors.
The recommender systems use collaborative filtering, which is based on the taste
information of the user to make automatic predictions. Collaborative filtering works
on a principle that if two users have the same opinion over one matter, they are more
likely to have a similar opinion on another different matter. Frameworks that utilize a
keyword-based approach for content-based sifting face the issue of synonymy
problem. Synonymy problems refer to the inability of the recommender system to
detect the different words of the same meanings, and thus, the systems treat each word
differently. The primary issue with collaborative filtering is collecting and weighing
the taste information for neighbour users. If the user can achieve an immediate rating
of the preferences, it can lead to accurate and precise recommendations.
3.2

Classification of publications

In Figure 2, we have classified relevant research papers that we studied in our work
for ontology-based recommender systems. A total of 15 journal paper publications
relevant to ontology-based recommender systems for context-aware were analyzed
and classified according to the year of publication. All the 15 papers classified in this
review study were published between 2003 and 2014.
A total of 10 of the papers were published between 2008 and 2014. From Figure 2,
it is clear that there is significant growth in the number of publications on an
ontology-based recommendation for context-aware from 2008 to 2014. Between 2003
and 2007, there is only a single relevant journal publication for each year. There is a
continuous increase between the years 2008–2014.

3.3

Ontology-based recommenders in context-aware

By using ontology representation language, we can achieve knowledge about
specific content. It has been proved that the ontological user profile improves
recommendation accuracy and diversity. In this approach, we have used different
ontology languages such as OWL, RDF, DAML, OIL, Ontology-based personalized
couple clustering (OBPC), Semantic, and XML.
The Web Ontology Language is a family of representation languages, and that unit
area is utilized to construct ontologies. The ontology is an accurate approach to
address classification networks and classes. Mainly, it defines the knowledge
associated with miscellaneous domain names. The OWL is characterized by formal
linguistics, and it is concocted on an XML for objects known as the RDF. Each unit
area is utilized for ontologies construction. Throughout the formation of the ontology
system, we tend to utilize the domain ontology encoded with the RDF representation
language.
Classification is conducted based on the domain scope ontology. We have included
domain ontology and product ontology in ontologies. A domain ontology represents
the concepts that are related to the realm elements of the world, for example, biology.
Product ontology is used for the description of products. Zhiwen Yu et al., [15]
developed a context representation model of ontology-based recommender using
OWL. To ensure interoperability with third-party services and applications. For
instance, Yannick et al., [12] used an ontology-based approach to express not only the
interests of the user for anything described in an ontology but also the target of
content for anything described in an ontology. The target mechanism was used in this
paper was to support context-based recommendations and can be used to support
other matching strategies. Collaborative filtering strategies infer the suitability of an
item to one or more types of users. If a user has bought an item, the system can infer
that other similar users could be interested in the same item. Then the recommender
can be added to this item as a target, which includes properties of the buyer’s profile.
3.4

Ontology-based recommendation techniques for context-aware

Ontology-based recommendation techniques are classified in Table 1. Table 1
shows that the ontology-based recommendation system and knowledge-based
recommendation system are most commonly used by all the 15 recommender system
users. In our survey, 11 out of the 15 recommenders used a hybrid technique isolated
with collaborative filtering and content-based approach. Only 4 out of 15 ontologybased recommenders use collaborative filtering and content-based approach without
isolation with the Hybrid recommender system.

Recommended ontology-based learning resources for context-aware

Table 2 tabulates the various types of an ontology-based recommender system. It is
evident that 11 out of 15 publications that we reviewed in this survey recommends
personalized curricula and learning materials, paths, and goals. For instance,
Giancarlo Guizzardi (2014) used the Infraware platform as a learning resource.
Yannick Naudet and Sabrina Mignon (2004) recommend TV programs and LOs as
learning resources, and Ana Régia Neves and Célia Ghedini Ralha (2013) and Oh
Byung Kwon (2003) used artificial intelligence resource for the agent-based
approach.

Content-Based Recommender Systems

Content-based recommender systems are used in information retrieval. First, terms
are assigned manually, which means while assigning terms manually, a technique has
to be chosen which compares these terms from the information in the client’s profile,
and a learning algorithm must be chosen to perform such techniques and then bring
the related results to the client [27].
The thoughts of term frequency (TF) and Inverse document frequency (IDF) are
used as a piece of information recuperation structures and content-based isolating
frameworks (for instance, content-based recommender). They are used to choose the
relative centrality of a record /article / news thing / film, et cetera. Content-based
filtering is another standard method while designing recommender systems is contentbased filtering. Content-based filtering methods are based on a description of the
object and a profile of the person’s choice. In a content-based recommender system,
key phrases are used to explain the items, and a personal profile is built to suggest the
kind of item this user likes. In different words, these algorithms try to recommend
objects that are just like those that a user favored in the past (or is examining inside

288

Paper—A Review of Content-Based and Context-Based Recommendation Systems

the present). Numerous candidate items are compared with items previously rated by
the user, and the best match result items are recommended. Yannick et al., [12] used a
content-based algorithm to filter the best result recommended to a user.
The main advantages of a content-based recommender system include
transparency, independence, and recommendations for unclassified entities. The
drawbacks include serendipity, partial content analysis, and overspecialization [22].
A content-based recommender system generates recommendations provided by the
user, either explicitly or by interface tapping. Considering that data, after the customer
profile has been generated, it can be used to generate recommendations for the user.
As the client provides more data sources or accepts activities suggestions, the engine
becomes progressively precise. By using a content-based recommender system,
instant results can be achieved. A content-based recommender system is much better
than a collaborative system as it provides an easy implementation. We have used this
system because it generated highly relevant and transparent results.
Content-based separating strategies often use content extraction and
characterization systems for building client profiles and additionally for portrayals of
content, i.e., item profiles. These techniques have a few weaknesses, e.g., bungle
between client profile things and profile terms, prompting low execution. Contentbased recommender frameworks prescribe items with comparable content to items the
client has adored some time recently. Cases of the content-based proposal are Fab,
which suggests site pages, and ELFI, which prescribes financing data from a database.
Content-based sifting frameworks adjust their conduct to singular clients by taking in
their inclinations from records that were at that point esteemed applicable. Contentbased sifting manages contrasting portrayals of the content of things (archives) with
portrayals of per user's interests, keeping in mind the end goal to discover things that
are most applicable to every client. This represents an errand of finding the best
portrayal for both the things (thing profile) and the clients (client profile). A client
profile speaks to a mapping of the real client's enthusiasm to a smaller model domain,
which is an estimate of the client's real certifiable interests. A client's profile and a
thing's profile should share a typical portrayal (for instance: portrayal by keywords) to
empower coordinating between the profiles.
The possibility of a Content-based recommender framework in an eLearning stage
can be outlined as follows: We Give the addresses that the student needs to visit. The
stage prescribes different addresses with content, which is like the content of the
addresses saw by the student. We fabricate the learner’s ontology profile by
extricating the student interests from that client's profile. Along these lines, we
manufacture the ontology-based framework. Diverse content-based suggestion
approaches have been utilized. Fundamentally, these methods are isolated in
Heuristic-based and Model-based methodologies. The initial ones compute utility
forecasts because of heuristic equations that are dependent on data recovery
techniques. The content recommender framework is relying upon the level of
similitude amongst things and articles that are required by the client in profile. It
implies it is utilized to foresee the question, as per the client’s intrigue and if it has
comparable content in another protest that is utilized to fulfil the client. These sorts of
the framework have limitations too.

Paper—A Review of Content-Based and Context-Based Recommendation Systems

There are two essential excellent conditions of a content-based approach: to begin
with, the model gauges, being established on resources rather than words, are more
correct; second, the model is vernacular self-sufficient, allowing course in
multilingual goals [28]. Content-based recommender frameworks mainly describe
every shopper without matching his or her interests to different customers. They can
give a rundown of content includes that clarifies why a thing has been prescribed.
Such a rundown can reinforce customer trust in the suggestion and mirror the buyer's
inclinations. In the content-based approach, shoppers can give some underlying data
about the item to help the framework. Content-based filtering is situated considering
the comparability of content (i.e., the client's profile and the records).
4.1

Ontology-based recommender system in content-based

The ontology-based recommender system is a formal representation of a
knowledge domain, whose semantics is defined by its composing concepts and
relationships. Ontologies can be used to express things unambiguously [19]. An
ontology is a conceptual model that can be applied to describe a domain of discourse,
modelling it as a set of concepts and relations. Recommender systems are founded on
different ontologies for instances domain ontology, task ontology, generic ontology.
Domain ontology is widely used in content-based recommender systems. Several
researchers have used ontologies to discover user preferences and innovations in
content-based recommender systems. For ontology construction, we create an office
area and office domain. Every domain comprises of subordinate ideas, occasions, and
properties. The e-learning frameworks are based on the core of the domain ontology.
If we can generate ontologies that can be used as the base for various frameworks,
they can support sharing, reusability, and regular phrasing. We have considered the
two-rule based domain ontology display, which contains learner’s advantage based
and bunch based. The mentioned framework is convenient to be implemented in
several recommendation systems without keeping the activity domain into
consideration. To reinforce the ideas and connections in the application domain, we
require conventional and transferable vocabulary. Semantic web people group resorts
to ontologies, i.e., conceptualizations that recognize common ideas and connections in
an application domain.

Ontology is an emerging innovation for semantic information representation,
which is associated with mastering systems. Our proposed technique models the
client’s profiles by reutilizing the information that is accessible in the domain
ontology, named as ontology profiles. The Hermes news portal (HNP) application
enables clients to discover and execute inquiries by utilizing a space ontology. The
main objective is to retrieve applicable news matters. The solitary, java-based
apparatus is used to utilize different semantic web innovations. Hermes assesses a
semantic approach that depends on ontology ideas. The methodologies that apply
domain-based inferences comprise producing deductions about the client's interests in
consideration of the various levelled structure characterized by the ontology. The
studies have enabled us to determine client inclinations for a few classes of TV
programs that are coarser-grained than those of the general ontology. We have
proposed an additional content-based technique for sifting and positioning the
pertinence of items for clients, which uses a progressive ontology. The Quickstep
recommender framework is displayed. Two exact investigations assess it in a genuine
work setting, measuring the viability of utilizing a progressive theme ontology
contrasted and an extendable level rundown. We can demonstrate that the data gave
by Web 2.0 administrations in a mix with a semantic Web ontology empowers the era
of applicable semantic label suggestions for archives [29].
Crossing over any barrier amongst labels and ontology, the approach portrayed the
advancement of ontology in light of label uses. The utilization of an ontological
content-based channel empowers personalization at each level of the ontology
progression. Consequently, a client can get a customized rundown of things at the root
level (i.e., the front page of the e-Paper) and at bringing down levels, as they select
particular points to peruse, e.g., an arrangement of customized business-related news
things are given when the client chooses to peruse the business class. There are
inadequate ontological content-based profiling models available to articulate the client
and content profiles in the ontology domain. All the issues related to the client’s
profile and related links can be resolved by utilizing the ontology.

Paper—A Review of Content-Based and Context-Based Recommendation Systems

The ontological and theoretical demonstration was equally utilized as a part of the
request to distinct client profiles. For instance, the four-level ontology is utilized as a
part of the Quickstep framework to recommend papers to experts by consolidating
content-based and collaborative filtering methods. In the initial segment, we have
planned the domain ontology that utilized the word Net. Yet, the phrasing or strategy
that is utilized as a part of the word Net is entirely different and more extensive than
numerous hypermedia. So, there was the issue of vagueness. In the next part, we have
outlined the learner’s ontology, so each learner has his own particular needs. This is
removed from domain ontology and displayed as a subset ontology. We have
dissected the structure of domain ontology and considered the semantic weights of the
client profiles, so we have produced the domain idea space and generated assemblies
of interests shared by specific users. Thus, those clients who share the same interests
of a particular idea are congregated to form groups containing a higher weight of
inclination. Domain ontology is considered as a crucial element in the models and
systems.
Ontology-based personalization is a critical assemblage of research. It is wealthier,
more exact than a keyword-based model. It gives fundamental alternatives to the
rudiments of client inclinations. It utilizes ontology content analysis for introducing
knowledge and for semantic inquiries. Ontology is utilized to isolate news things and
enables the client to choose the points of interest. Word sense is utilized to build the
precision of the arrangement of news things. Besides, it is convinced that the
discovered lexical overview significantly presents the domain ontology. An ontology
that is utilized as a part of the instructive example plans to tackle the issue of structure
and portrayal of the particular example. The ontology provides a consummate type of
portrayal and characterizing standard vocabulary. Procedures that are utilized to
create ontology are dependent on the domain of ontology. The general assumption
that we get from these techniques is that the lexical approach depends on the WordNet
that requires more changes to gain from semantic profiles. Thus, these upgrades
coordinate domain ontology that gets all the more capable information approach.
We have proposed a display of the client’s data by consistently incorporating
information incorporating the prompt and prior responses of the client. Also,
information gathered from a prior ontology is used as a portrayal of the domain of the
intrigue. In the current structure, the client setting is addressed to utilize an
ontological client profile. Initially, each ontological client profile is considered as an
illustration of the reference ontology. The e-Paper framework is a customer service
application. On the server-side, it computes news coming ceaselessly from news
suppliers and groups every news thing to subject ideas utilizing news ontology.
Ontology is a conceptualization of a domain into a human-reasonable framework. Our
ontological way to deal with recommender frameworks offers many favorable
circumstances and a couple of advantages.

Content-based recommender

The main reason for analysis is to understand the content-based recommender
system in different fields of today’s area of study. In a flexible semantic inference

methodology, a proposal procedure utilizes content-based separating and a method
that was about deserted years ago because of a few limitations uncertain in the best in
art. In particular, our approach solves the overspecialization of the content-based
suggestions that things like those the client knows. To battle the overspecialization of
the explained suggestions, our system utilizes semantic derivation methods. Semantic
ontologies give additional learning about the client premiums and permit the
recommender framework to contrast them and the accessible information more
efficiently. The proposed methodology is very sufficiently straightforward to be
actualized in numerous recommender frameworks, disregarding their application
domain. This activity portrays the Web assets by ontology and reasons for their
semantics. Such thinking permits to derive semantic connections among the assets and
find learning for improved data recovery tasks.
We have proposed a semantic recommender framework for e-learning by methods
in which learners will have the capacity to discover and pick the correct learning
materials reasonable to their field of premium. Semantic web innovation puts more
attention on learning portrayal and administration. The primary reason for the
semantic Web is to empower mechanized coordinated effort over the Internet, because
of metaphysics. Philosophy is the root of the semantic Web. By utilizing philosophy,
the semantic methods are provided for traditional e-learning. The ontology presents
materials that are identified with our space in e-learning and semantic connection
between them. To produce a recommender framework, it is essential to characterize a
customized strategy and suggestion calculation. The customized content suggestion is
a noteworthy efficacy for modern eLearning frameworks. The recommender
framework in e-learning utilizes predefined principles to channel data and prescribe
content to learners. In e-learning, content sifting prescribes considering the
comparability between content for one client while collaboratively separating
functions considering closeness between client profiles. Content-based and
collaborative filtering separating works contemplating rating framework. There is
inconsistency with the e-learning frameworks, which requires sharing and reusability.
The absence of reusability and share the capacity of current information in e-learning
frameworks have emerged as the most significant challenge in the modern era. Our
proposed system utilizes the semantic Web and ontology since ontology empowers
information to be reusable and sharable because of its auxiliary nature [30]. Along
these lines, a web-based learning condition is considered as an essential part of today's
training.
Most recommender frameworks utilize a straightforward twofold class approach,
utilizing a client profile, and recognizing what is fascinating or not for the client. The
Quickstep recommender framework utilizes a multi-class approach, permitting a
profile for space ideas (inquire about paper points) to be manufactured [31]. The
multi-class characterization is less exact than other double order frameworks.
However, it permits particular class criticism and space information (through an “is -a
progressive system”) to upgrade the profiling procedure. Two trials were led to survey
observationally both the general adequacy of the Quickstep recommender framework
and to evaluate the impact made by utilization of the ontology. We have utilized a
philosophy to examine how area learning can help in the securing of client interests.

iJET ‒ Vol. 16, No. 03, 2021

Paper—A Review of Content-Based and Context-Based Recommendation Systems

The reason for the two trials is to analyse a grouping of clients utilizing a content
marking procedure with a grouping of clients utilizing a level rundown naming
technique. Our theory for the content gathering's clean execution is that the is-a chain
of command creates a rounder by adding general superclass themes if a client uses a
particular subject.
The average client profiling approach for recommender frameworks is contentbased, utilizing a paired model speaking to what clients find fascinating and
uninteresting. This thought has prompted content-based recommender frameworks,
which unpretentiously scrutinize the client's profiles on the Web and suggest new
pages that relate to the client profile. With adequate positive and negative
illustrations, current machine learning strategies can arrange new pages with fantastic
exactness. Various machine learning techniques have already employed in the domain
of healthcare [32, 33], finance [34], and surveillance [35]. Client's information prerequisite obtaining and an investigation is imperative for a customized or client
versatile learning framework. Conventional instructive methodologies are typically
instructor driven, not understudy driven, because they don't adequately consider the
distinction in qualities between various understudies. Keeping in mind the end goal is
to upgrade understudy driven learning and guideline effectiveness. Educators ought to
comprehend the understood information pre-requisite of understudies to get ready and
plan their showing materials for the understudies.
We have frequently considered the rank of the learning pre-requisite instead of the
correct estimation of it. This implies what a client's versatile or customized
framework is most concerned with, and which components are required by an
understudy. For a customized course plan in an eLearning framework, it is crucial to
obtain the client’s additional information. In this framework, two methods have been
proposed and executed for the essential data retrieval of the customers inside the elearning structure about the course content. The next era of e-learning is ready with
the enormous market, a market, and advancement that incorporates getting the hang of
planning, exhibiting, and online support.
Moreover, everything hitting us electronically can be called e-learning. The
conventional showing strategy is now demonstrating its confinements that
understudies from various foundations are as yet given a similar learning substance in
the meantime, and they may just enthusiasm for some portion of the entire learning
content. We have examined the instrument with the learning base editorial manager.
The goal of the semantic Web is to furnish conveyed data with exceedingly
characterized meaning, the reason for people and machines. E-learning is an essential
space that can be benefitted from semantic web advancement. Semantic web advances
are a promising mechanical establishment for the coming era of e-learning
frameworks [36].
In this paper, we have proposed how Semantic Web headways and particularly
ontologies can improve functionalities of a present Java instructing system. The plan
for such a flexible and altered content structure relies on semantic web rules and
developments. The type of a few ontologies has been proposed which relate to the
parts of a content-based framework. Data over-burden is winding up noticeably
extreme in our present-day times of broad communications, worldwide

correspondence offices, and learning the client's capacity to recognize significant data
from unessential. Like this, huge researchers have been investigating robotized sifting
frameworks that provide clients with attractive and fascinating data [37]. In the most
recent decade, the purposed recommender frameworks have been picking up energy
as another effective method for unpredictability when hunting down essential data.
Moreover, recommenders have additionally pulled in expanding open enthusiasm,
levelling the ground for new business openings in various fields, for example, webbased business and Digital TV [38]. In these areas, their principal target is to filter
through substantial arrangements of data and to choose those items the clients will
acknowledge, considering their past interests, history of search, and statistic data. Our
reasoning-based strategy has been executed in a recommender structure for Interactive
Digital Television. We have observed that the proposed framework offers precise,
updated proposals that would go unnoticed in the conventional strategies.
In travel ontology for advance recommender frameworks, fly out data is expanding
to offer the vacationers on the sites. Since there is a considerable amount of data given
on the Web. The client gets puzzled in finding ideal data [39]. Keeping in mind the
end goal is to discover the arrangement of these web issues, the possibility of the
semantic Web has correspondence amongst humans and PC. The semantic Web is not
just concentrating on the recovering techniques for content coordinating.
Additionally, it can recover the semantic relationship of each protest utilizing the
equivalent word, antonym, and hyponym connection of words.
These days, there is an extensive variety of data, for example, the vacation spots,
settlement, and nearby gourmet nourishment to claim the visitor on the Web. The
travel specialist assumes an imperative part in both arranging and suggesting for
customized travel course. Additionally, when surfing on web administrations, end
clients progressively need more effective instruments to be able to do grouping and
translating the tremendous measure of heterogeneous data accessible on the Web. Be
that as it may, the data has extreme impediments due to showing in HTML, which is
intended for people to peruse instead of machines to translate and naturally handle. In
this framework, we have proposed the smart suggestion framework in light of travel
ontology. In like manner, we have utilized the data of Jeju (located in southern Korea,
is renowned for a volcanic island), for instance, lodging, fascination, and so on. The
proposed framework can prescribe vacationer more smart data utilizing properties and
connections of travel ontology. The framework oversees discovering customized
interests and plotting area of voyager on the AlMap. The Jeju travel ontology
comprises of extricating of various leveled data and example data. Our framework can
recover Jeju travel data more effortlessly, and we bolster Jeju travel course
suggestions relying upon ontology (inclination profile and exchange profile).
Likewise, it is mapping amongst representation and Almap (a sort of Digital guide)
and application programming interface (API). If the client needs an incredibly delicate
area. We can show precise areas from recovery utilizing this computerized outline. In
this framework, we have proposed an insightful suggestion framework because of Jeju
travel ontology to take care of many answers-issue. The proposed framework can
prescribe the traveler more useful data utilizing properties, connections of travel
ontology and help them to expect disarray of streets or attractions.

Paper—A Review of Content-Based and Context-Based Recommendation Systems

While most methodologies explore traditional data recovery procedures, e.g.,
closest neighbour inquiries in metric domains, accessibility, and utilization of
wealthier semantic meta-data about items may additionally enhance suggestion
quality essentially. Gigantic scientific categorizations for item orders are
transitioning, e.g., the United Nations Standard Products and Services Classification
(UNSPSC, for example, Amazon.com order scientific categorizations for books,
DVDs, CDs, and clothing [40]. We have battled the overspecialized idea of customary
content-based recommender frameworks. It proposed things fundamentally the same
as those the client knows (principally because of the selection of syntactic
coordinating methods).
The oddity is that our content-based approach defeats this impediment without
considering the inclinations of different people, which was the central arrangement
proposed so far in writing at the costs of presenting other extreme disadvantages. Our
approach is non-sufficiently specific to be utilized as a part of a wide assortment of a
domain, furthermore, recommender frameworks. The proposition has been
preparatory assessed by statistics-driven tests, including genuine clients in the
proposal of Digital TV content. The outcomes uncover the clients' fulfilment
concerning the precision and assorted qualities of the thinking driven content-based
suggestions. Moreover, in the word-based case, we considered a word list record
portrayal, where each word has a score contrarily relative to the word recurrence in
the news corpus. We have introduced another rendition of Site IF, a recommender
framework for a Website of multilingual news. Exploring content-based archive
portrayal, we have depicted a model of the client's advantages in light of word
faculties rather than merely on words [41].
We have made informed recommender to address the issue of utilizing purchaser
assessment about items and communicated online in freestyle content to create item
suggestions. Our procedure manufactures a gathering of necessary customer item
audits. The strategy for gathering audits takes after the calculations for robotized news
extraction from news destinations. Once the item's feelings mining base was
populated, we have utilized the content mining methods to remove valuable data from
survey remarks. At this point, we will discuss the general system for mechanizing the
utilization of customer audits and the structure's segments. We have utilized existing
calculations, for instance, in the content mining process because we will show our
approach's qualities. The framework can give the client a rundown of some of these
supporters, and their past buys to clarify and make the client sure about the proposal.
Research utilization of audits in a recommender framework is still in its earliest
stages. To the best of our insight, this is the primary endeavour to construct a
recommender framework in light of survey remarks in free shape content.
Different analysts have utilized surveys to give some clarification about an item
proposal. Despite these issues, we have considered the outcomes we got to be great
since we can precisely outline an expansive part of a survey into the predefined
ontology. Executing this technique gives our framework a chance to utilize important
printed data to make suggestions. This enables our framework to conquer the frosty
begin problem, which challenges collaborative filtering procedures. Numerous
personalization approaches depend on a client profile, which is an information

occasion of a client demonstrate that is caught considering the client's communication.
Client profiles may incorporate statistic data and, besides, address the interests and
inclinations of the client. Client profiles that are kept up after some time can be
arranged into here and now what is more, long term profiles. Here and now, profiles
can be used to monitor the client's later and quicker evolving interests. Long term
profiles reveal client intrigues that are generally stable a time duration. A spreading
enactment calculation is utilized to keep up and incrementally refresh the intrigue
scores considering the client's progressing conduct. We have demonstrated that repositioning the list items is related to the intrigue scores. The semantic proof caught in
an ontological client profile empowers a versatile framework to exhibit the most
important outcomes to the client. If the keywords of the client profile are not the same
as those of reports, important archives may be missed. However, a specific word may
have more than one value, prompting unessential archives being recovered.

Hybrid Recommender System

Recent studies have established that a hybrid method, combining collaborative
filtering and content-based filtering may be extra effective in a few cases. Hybrid
strategies can be carried out in numerous approaches: by way of making contentbased and collaborative-based predictions one at a time and after that combining
them; or by adding content-based abilities to a collaborative-based approach (and vice
versa); or by unifying the methods into one version [20]. It is a combination of
content-based filtering and collaborative based filtering. A hybrid recommender joins
content-based and CF strategies under a solitary system. Content and CF have
numerous impediments and can be secured from the Hybrid arrangement of the
proposal [7]. Hybrid framework joins with content and CF with one of the following
methodologies:
• First, execute all techniques and afterward consolidate the outcomes
• Blend a few components of content with the shared approach
• Incorporate some CF attributes with the content approach
The strategy that we have used to outline a hybrid framework depends on a blend
of collaborative and content-based that learn and dissect client profile that because of
content by utilizing diverse techniques. Our hybrid data filtering approach allows
appropriately gathering profile closeness between two given clients. However, the two
operators have not evaluated any items in like manner.

Analysis of Publications

We have carried several studies on the ontology-based recommendation in contextaware from the year 2003 to 2014. For instance, [15] designed an architecture named:
The CoMeR architecture to support media recommendation, adaptation, and delivery
for smartphones. By using CoMeR, they have made a context-aware movie
recommendation system for cell phones called ContAwareMovie. This
recommendation system recommended movies based on the context information,

which used hybrid recommendation techniques and ontology-based knowledge
structures in its recommendation approach.
Similarly, [12] presented a personalization system in his work, which used
ontology to represent knowledge and matchmaking algorithm for multimedia content
recommendations. The target mechanism was used to support the context-based
recommendation. Collaborative filtering techniques were used to present and item
which suit one or more type of users. Tim et al., [17] proposed a framework named:
Discover, which can integrate context information in the recommendation process.
Discover used hybrid recommender systems as it provides integration of many
recommender techniques and context information. Christian Räck et al., [18]
suggested AMAYA recommender system that could deliver convenient news articles
for each user. Giancarlo et al., [19] developed a recommender system named: COReS
(context-aware. Ontology-based recommender system for service recommendation),
which used the abilities of the Infraware platform to support service selection by
making services offered by this program more efficient, personalized, and proactive
and then it will also satisfy the needs of a user in its context.
Iván et al., [7] proposed a hybrid recommender system named: News@hand, which
combined content features and collaborative information to make relevant news
suggestions according to the user's profile and user's contextual information. They
combined the ontology-based personalization system with context-aware
recommendations to give accurate suggestions. Yannick et al., [12] proposed an
ontology-based matchmaking approach for context-aware recommendations. They
have presented a survey of an ontology set and a matchmaking algorithm that makes
accurate recommendations by keeping a given user profile and situation, interests, and
associated context. Yuichi Nakamura et al., [16] proposed an ontology-based
methodology for semantic recommendations.
InnarLiiv et al., [20] implemented a recommendation platform named:
SMARTMUSEUM. SMARTMUSEUM recommendation platform combines a
semantics-based approach and ontologies-based method with data mining and
statistical techniques. They have presented the architecture and the main techniques of
this system. Dong Liu et al., [21] proposed an ontology-based context model which
uses RDF rectification and OWL to explain temporal characteristics and to derive
high-level contexts from raw data-keeping given user's contextual information. They
also improved the SAW algorithm to deal with semantics and proposed appropriate
service to the user. Ana Régia et al., [22] proposed an agent-based architecture for
context-aware and personalized event recommendation systems based on ontology
and spreading algorithms to offer context-aware recommender systems an intelligent
processing technique.
The proposed agent-based architecture was authenticated with the modelling and
implementation of eAgora. Luis Omar et al., [23] proposed a recommender system
named: RecomMetz, which is a context-aware mobile recommender system and is
based on semantic web technologies, determines which movie showtime are to be
presented to a user keeping given the location, time, and the crowd. Antonio Moreno
et al., [24] implemented SigTur / E-destination for tourism and leisure interests. They
used domain ontology to account for each user; the system will take as much

information about the user as possible to provide an accurate recommendation. OH
ByungKwon et al., [25] developed a prototype agent-based system named: Contextaware multimedia Agent (CAMA). They focused on how the semantic Web
developed a context-aware recommendation system, and to determine a way to
represent multimedia-based ontology by extending ARG. Hua Xiao et al., [26]
proposed a context modelling method that could handle various context types and
values dynamically. They also used ontologies to enhance what a user might need.
Some other ontologies are also used, which include generic ontology and reference
ontology. Moreover, ontology-based representation language is widely used is OWL.
Other languages that are used along with or separately from OWL include RDF
representation, DAML (Agent markup language), Semantic, and OIL.
Other learning resources include artificial intelligence, prototyping and TV
programs, and Los. The recommended resources that are presented in Yannick Naudet
[12], Tim Hussein, Timm Linder [17], Christian Räck [18] recommended
personalized curricula. In contrast, Yuichi Nakamura [16], Innar Liiv [20], Tanel
Tammet [20], Zhiwen Yu [16], and Xingshe Zhou [15] recommended learning
materials, paths, and goals.

Conclusion and Future Work

We have presented a brief review of ontology-based recommendation for contextaware. Our work discloses that the ontology-based recommendation system,
combined with other recommendation techniques, is universally used to recommend
context-aware resources.
Ontology domain knowledge can efficiently contribute to enhance the accuracy and
quality of recommendations. However, cold-start drawbacks remain the same.
For future work, there are three context-aware recommendation system)
architectural models that are contextual pre-filtering, contextual post-filtering, and
contextual modelling. We will try to overcome challenges that we face in pre-filtering
models that are context over-Specification that include the Sparsity problem: overly
specified context may not have enough training examples for accurate prediction
Generalization in which we use latent factors models or dimensionality reduction
approaches to overcome this problem. We can further apply context-aware splitting
approaches based on contextual pre-filtering to produce a 2D data set that
incorporates context information associated with preference results. This will also
lead to the sparsity problem, which we will need to overcome. We can also introduce
semantics into the similarity of contexts to further alleviate the sparsity of contexts.
We can also introduce factorization in contextual modelling to fit the data using
various models. One of them is tensor factorization that can extend the twodimensional matrix factorization into a multi-dimensional version of the same
problem and then multi-dimensional into lower-dimensional representation. We can
also implement various statistics and data mining techniques present to our data to get
accurate and more specific contextual information.

Paper—A Review of Content-Based and Context-Based Recommendation Systems

The research on all the publications concluded that: in a content-based
recommender system, the system will recommend users all the sites and data or
information in which the user is interested or based on the client’s interests or recent
searches and ratings different sites. All the papers are directly relevant to e-learning
and many different fields in content-based recommender systems. Using semanticbased, we can also recommend news items to the users, depending on their interests.
After our research about recommender systems, we concluded that content,
collaborative, and semantic are the significant and useful recommender systems to
recommend users and clients according to their needs and interests.
7.1

Possible extensions

• Other essential research methods that have been investigated in recommender
frameworks are writing incorporate logic, dependability, versatility, and security
issues of recommender frameworks
• In the suggestion procedure, the engine analyses the things that were evaluated by
the client with the things he did not rate and searches for likenesses. Those things
that are, for the most part, like the decidedly evaluated ones, will be prescribed to
the client. We should prescribe the user not only the things that he rated good
points but also the things he searches frequently
• In this recommender system, we mostly used domain ontology in suggesting items
and things according to the client’s interests and likeness. We may also use task
ontology instead of the domain
• We can also design content-based recommender systems in XML and jess rules,
and we can also implement KB/OB recommendation techniques
• We can also apply content based on many domains to set the user profile
• Content-based fuzzy techniques can also be implemented to determine the items
related to the user’s interests. A fuzzy item representation technique will find
similar measures
• The recommendation system can be extended in multi-criteria ratings
• More comprehensive methods can provide much better suggestions
7.2

Limitations

• To make the ontologies a challenging task and it requires a lot of skills and hard
work
• There are many obstacles in content-based recommender systems, like experienced
researchers, who can only work on these systems
